This is Levi, I am a 33 year old ex-chemistry/bio/and STEM teacher who is currently in Tempe, AZ
going through a software developer program called Rockit bootcamp. I will have more about myself
later, but let's get to the tech portion for right now.

So I started learning jekyll today. Very interesting technology. Seems to streamline the making of
websites, and templating them for quick turnarounds. I am hoping this can be something that
employers can appreciate. But if it's not i see the posibility of churning out passive income streams 
through static site generation. Or at the very least, I think the information that points to
revenue generation.

Very glad to be learning these cool tools. Rockit Bootcamp is very tough, but i can see
substantial growth in this process.

Ok, on to the real stuff. Just got a great intro to OOCSS from Brad. Interesting to see the 
differing opinions. Especially about utility classes. Then we had a github review about push / pulls
with Kevin. Its really kind of a great resource to collaborate on or get different perspectives.

To round out the day I am going to finish the CSS project. Afterwords i will try and post the
finished product.
