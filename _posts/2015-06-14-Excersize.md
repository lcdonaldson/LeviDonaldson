# These are a few of my favorite things

Actually this whole post is an excersize in Brigs favorite things.

My favorite thing has been learning the javascript behaviors at Rockit Bootcamp.
I have to be honest this is the hardest part, and i still dont know what im doing.
However, getting things to work with javascript and adding functionality to web projects 
is pretty amazing.
