# Completed the twitter mockup project!

Last week we had to make a mockup version of twitter which was essentially 
what we had done the week before. However, instead of using handlebars to merely 
make templates of a local host served page, this time we had to post to a database
via ajax calls. While the ajax itself wasn't that bad, the mental hoolahoops required
to make the correct connections of tweets and replies complete blew my mind. I'm glad
we can review this tomorrow, because this was crazy hard.

    I do have to say that coding with a group took my understanding to a whole new level.

Starting tomorrow we are on the downhill slide of this bootcamp. We are now over half way
and it completely flew by. I'm excited to now start putting together the pieces of my 
final project. Little by little I can see the puzzle formulating. 

Well, it's certainly past twelve a.m. so time to get some sleep. I have a feeling
tomorrow's information is going to be the equivalent of a traumatic brain injury. Monday's
at Rockit tend to leave you questioning the world you knew on Sunday.
