The ultimate purpose of this blog endeavor was to learn about jekyll and how it functions, So I guess I cant totally
write it off as a flop. But as far as keeping up with a blog, I realized it's just not my thing right now. I have since
discovered Hugo, Wordpress, and other people who like to blog more than I do.
